# Question 14: 
Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

# Explain & TIP: 
Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests. Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation.
