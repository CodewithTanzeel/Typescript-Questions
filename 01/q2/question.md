# Question 2:
Personal Message: Store a person’s name in a variable and print a message to them, like
“Hello Tanzeel Ahmad, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?”

# Explain & TIP:
First, make a variable to save a name. Then, use this name to say hello. Variables keep data you can use later. 


```
let person: string = "Tanzeel Ahmad Ahmed"; // This saves the name

console.log(`Hello ${person}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`); // This shows the message
```
