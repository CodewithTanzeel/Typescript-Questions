# Question 23: 
**Conditional Tests:*** Write a series of conditional tests. Predict the results of each test.

# Explain & TIP: 
Conditional tests check if something is true or false. Writing different tests helps you understand how conditions work in programming.


```
let car = 'subaru';

console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.");
console.log(car == 'subaru'); // True

console.log("Is car == 'toyota'? I predict False.");
console.log(car == 'toyota'); // False

// Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
```
