# Question 8: 
You should create four lines that look like this:

```
console.log(5 + 3)
```

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

# Explain & TIP: 
Just like before, use basic math operations to display the number 8. This reinforces how to display outputs in coding.
