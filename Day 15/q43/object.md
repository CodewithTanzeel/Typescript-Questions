# Question 43:
***Unchanged Magicians:*** Start with your work from Exercise 40. Call the function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array. Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.

# Explain & TIP: 
Creating a copy of an array before modifying it allows you to maintain the original data. This exercise demonstrates array copying and manipulation.
