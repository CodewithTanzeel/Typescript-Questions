# Question 44:
***Sandwiches:*** Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.

# Explain & TIP: 
Utilizing rest parameters allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments, useful for handling lists of data like sandwich ingredients.
