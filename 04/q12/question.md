# Question 12: 
***Greetings:*** Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

# Explain & TIP: 
This builds on the previous exercise. Now, you’re not just listing names, you’re using them in a sentence to make a personalized message for each friend.
