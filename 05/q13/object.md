# Question 13: 
Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

# Explain & Tip: 
Arrays help you group related items, like types of transportation. This way, you can talk about each one using a loop.
