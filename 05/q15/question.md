# Question 15: 
Changing Guest List: One of your guests can't make it to the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations with a replacement guest.

# Explain & TIP: 
Arrays are flexible. You can replace an item if someone can't make it, then loop through the list again for new invitations.
