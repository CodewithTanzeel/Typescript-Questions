# Question 42:

***Great Magicians:*** Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

# Explain & Tip
Modifying array contents within a function demonstrates how functions can change data. This shows the impact of passing arrays by reference.
